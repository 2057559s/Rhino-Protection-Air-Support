# Rhino-Protection-Air-Support
The situation for the Rhino population is a lot worse than is generally perceived by the public. This year alone   
more than 500 Rhino's have been lost due to poaching. The criminals responsible have no regard for the animals and 
are brutal and cruel, severely injuring the Rhinos and leaving them to die from their horrendous injuries. I have 
therefor volunteered my skills as a pilot to a pro-active approach with Idefix Flight Travel and a private Rhino 
Protection Unit in Southern Africa, to fight the crimes committed against Rhinos and raise awareness of the issue. 
The unit is currently working on an air-support presence and requires assistance in this establishment.
